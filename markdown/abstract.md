Michelangelo is a hybrid Markdown-LaTeX template for *creating a book* (or any other document) using **Markdown files** that can transparently include \LaTeX commands: it is a generalization of the Thesis which I created on **TwoBinPack** \cite{TWOBINPACKSITE} - my MSc project in Computer Engineering.

Michelangelo is both simple and effective:

* you can write most of the document as simple *Markdown* content. You can also (and should) partition it into multiple Markdown files - one per chapter

* you should be able to include *any* LaTeX command in your Markdown source


Therefore, Markdown is employed as a quick and expressive shortcut syntax for LaTeX - a sort of effective *syntactic sugar*.

My Thesis was written in English but also included an Italian abstract - which is why Michelangelo provides *bilingual tools* as well.
